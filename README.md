# busapp209
Bus app for Singaporeans

1. App.py -- Where the main bot run 
2. Config.py -- For setting up sensitive password / information configuration 
3. mod.py -- API request to aid App.py
4. Procfile -- Instruction for Heroku to run my App.py 


This is my first ever self-project, doing this for fun!
The bot is still in beta development, if you got any idea how to make it faster, please get in touch with me :) !
